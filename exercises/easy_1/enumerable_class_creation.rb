# Assume we have a Tree class that implements a binary tree.

# class Tree
  # ...
# end

# A binary tree is just one of many forms of collections, such as Arrays,
# Hashes, Stacks, Sets, and more. All of these collection classes include the
# Enumerable module, which means they have access to an each method, as well as
# many other iterative methods such as map, reduce, select, and more.

# For this exercise, modify the Tree class to support the methods of
# Enumerable. You do not have to actually implement any methods -- just show
# the methods that you must provide.

class Tree
  include Enumerable

  def each; end

  def <=>; end
end

# The Enumerable module specifies that the class must provide a method each which
# yields successive members of the collection, in addition to a <=> operator.
